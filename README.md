This is the repository for my personal wiki maintained with vimwiki. Currently all the files are in wiki syntax, but Github still can rendered it quite nicely (except you can't click the link inside the `[[ ]]` ).

You prefered the HTML version of these, it's available on [jurnalanas.com/notebook](https://www.jurnalanas.com/notebook)

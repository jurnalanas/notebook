== How a good day looks like ==

*rooms for improvement:*


- when you wake up early, around 3am is the best
- when you work in something that you interested in, perhaps an important personal project, before Subuh prayer
- when you workout in the morning, especially doing morning run
- read a good classic book

in the middle of the days, you get done around 4 hours of deep work.

if you are in the office, try to:
- listen to a good podcast when working
- use kanbanflow to track the progress
- make sure you got 2 hours minimum before taking a break
- you come home around isya prayer
- make a cup of tea, and read a good book

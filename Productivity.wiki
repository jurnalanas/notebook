== What to do when you have ZERO motivation ==

1. Simply go outside and take a walk
  - shinrin-yoku or "forest bathing"
  - Recommendations: Use your phone light to wake you up but playing exercise app on while you have nature music on
2. Decide on a **single task**, and stop trying to convince yourself that when you can study with sailor moon reruns, in the background, *kyle*..
3. Clear to neutral
  - Recommendations: Clearing up the clutter( A place for everything and everything in it's place)
  - like one chef said, "mise en place" - Everything in its place
4. Use the "low effort" hack
  - Recommendations: Do what's easy firstï»¿
